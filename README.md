# 🎬 Movie Data Cleaning, EDA & Correlation Analysis (Python)  

This project involves **cleaning, exploring, and analyzing** a dataset of movies. The objective is to:  

- Perform **data cleaning** to handle missing values, fix incorrect data types, and standardize fields.  

- Conduct **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand trends, distributions, and patterns in the data.  

- Analyze **correlations** between key numerical features to identify relationships.  

## 📌 Key Analysis Steps 
1️⃣ **Data Cleaning**:
- Handled missing values by removing incomplete records.  
- Converted columns to appropriate data types (e.g., `budget`, `gross`, `votes`).  
- Extracted and corrected the **release year** from a non-standardized column.  


2️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
- Visualized distributions of **budget, gross revenue, and genre frequency**.  
- Identified the **top companies** based on average gross revenue.  
- Explored relationships between numerical features.

3️⃣ **Correlation Analysis**  
- Examined the **relationship between budget and gross revenue** using scatter plots and regression analysis.  
- Generated a **correlation heatmap** to highlight feature relationships.  
- Found that **budget and votes** had the strongest correlation with **gross revenue**.
## 🔍Key Findings
- Higher budgets tend to result in higher revenue.
- Votes also correlate strongly with gross revenue, suggesting that popular movies tend to perform well financially.
- Some movie genres and companies dominate in terms of revenue.
## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** – Core programming language
- **Pandas** – For data cleaning & transformation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – For visualization
